# TodoMVC with React + Apollo Client

## What?!

This is a take on the classic [TodoMVC app](https://todomvc.com) but written to use Apollo's new architecture showcasing local state.

Yes, this is overkill for a todo app, please don't use this if all you are doing is managing a few local state pieces. However, it can serve as a starting point for managing local state using Apollo for larger applications
